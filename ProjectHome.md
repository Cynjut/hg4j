**Hg4J** is pure Java library that provides an API to access [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) repositories and a toolkit to solve some common tasks. Now it focuses on read-only operations, with few write operations added in 1.1, and eventually complete support for the Mercurial DVCS will be added.

Primary benefit of using **Hg4J** is that Python installation is no longer needed to access a Mercurial repository from your Java application, which is especially important for web applications within Java web servers or any other restricted environment. It's small, it's fast and (hopefully) easy to use.
